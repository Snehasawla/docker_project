## Getting start with docker
Build the Docker image: ```docker build -t my-app .```
Run the Docker container: ```docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app```

This will build and run your Next.js application inside a Docker container, making it accessible on http://localhost:3000.

Create a Dockerfile in the root of your Next.js project:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js application
RUN npm run build

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
